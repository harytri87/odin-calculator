# Calculator

Last project from the Foundations Course on
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)

[Live preview](https://harytri87.github.io/odin-calculator/)

This project combined HTML, CSS and JavaScript from what I've learned
so far in the Foundations Course.
