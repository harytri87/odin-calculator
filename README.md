# Calculator

Last project from the Foundations Course on
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)

This project combined HTML, CSS and JavaScript from what I've learned
so far in the Foundations Course.

I was a bit cocky, thinking I could take a different approach than the one suggested in the
assignment notes. This branch works perfectly the way I wanted (mimicking the Windows 11 calculator),
but it took a lot of trial and error, and I feel it might cause problems for future features and fixes.

So I’ll start fresh and follow the approach from the assignment notes in another branch, while
keeping this one as a reference.
